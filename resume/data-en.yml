about: Hi, I'm Gabriel, popularly known as "Potato". I have been interested in Web programming since 2005, and in 2008, when I had my first computer, I created several test sites of my own. In 2013 I graduated as a technician in IT focused on Web Development, but I didn't apply it for any job at the time. Only in 2017, when I finished my second ETEC, I've worked on some websites for local businesses, until in 2019 I was called to the City Hall. I didn't leave programming aside, using my knowledge to automate tables with VBA. Today, I'm in my freshman year at FATEC, looking to reintegrate myself into the job market as a Junior Web Developer
